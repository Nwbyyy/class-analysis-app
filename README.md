# class-analysis-app
The goal of this app is to allow WPI professors to quickly learn about their students
Features that the professor must have data for: student name, year, name, and GPA
This data needs to be in an excel sheet that is in the same directory as the code
The user will be prompted to put the name of the file and then make a graph
